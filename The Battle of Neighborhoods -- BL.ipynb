    "Meanwhile, Bronx remains to be one of the most diverse boroughs in New York City. In 2018, there were 1.12 times more Other (Hispanic) residents (464k people) in Bronx County, NY than any other race or ethnicity (Data USA). Hispanics (all races) accounts for 56.4% of the total population, while White non-Hispanic population were only 9% of the total. The most common foreign languages spoken in Bronx County, NY are Spanish, Yoruba, Twi, Igbo, or Other Languages of Western Africa, and French (Incl. Cajun).\n",

And imagine, for this study, a Hispanic immigrant family is look for settle in Bronx, and the criteria the family is considering, other than job location, transportation access, housing prices, are safety and places to eat. So which neighborhoods in Bronx stand out? -- This is the problem this report is trying address."
